# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
In this module we used SQL (Structure Query Language) to query our database in Postgres. This entailed using SELECT, ORDER BY, FROM, INTO, JOIN, WHERE, AND DISTINCT ON statements.

### Purpose
The purpose of this task was to find out the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Analysis

* There are only 1549 mentorship eligible employees
* There are 7 unique retiring titles on the other hand
* There are 90398 unique titles
* The criteria for mentorship eligible employees seems deeply flawed.

## Summary

In conculsion, there does seem to be enough mentorship eligible employees to fill the gap of the retiring employees

### Conclusion
There are 90398 retiring titles and only 1549 mentorship eligible employees.

There are not enough qualified, mentorship-ready employees in the departments to be mentored by the retiring generation of employees.
